REACT vs Next js 
    - By default next js prerenders every page in the application
    - Pre render means Next js generates HTML for each page in advance instead of having it all done on the client side JavaScript. 
    - Pre render improves performance. HTML is already generated. 
    - Helps in SEO 

Next js supports two forms of pre rendering
    - Static Generation 
    - Server Side Rendering 

Static Generation 
    - HTML pages are rendered at build time. 
    - used for blog pages, e-commerce pages, documentation pages and marketing pages. 
    - Our Html pages are automatically static generated when we build our application. 

- Production Server - an optimized build is created once and you deploy what you build. You cant make code changes on the go once its deployed. 
Dev Server- make changes in our code and changes refleccted on the browser

- for Next js for production builds, a page will be pre-rendered once when we run the build command. 

- for development builds, the page will be pre-rendered once when we run the request is made. to make sure changes are made during development. 

- Static Generation with getStaticProps can be used to fetch a list of articles, products or topics 

getStaticProps runs only the server side. The function will never return client side. 
    The code you write inside getStaticProps wont even be included in the JS bundle that is sent in the browser. 
    - You can write server side code directly in getStaticProps
    - Accessing the file system using the fs module or querying a database can be done inside the getStaticProps. 
    - Only run in a page and cannot be runned in a regular component file 
    - it is used only in pre-rendering and not client side data fetching 
    - it should return an object 
    - it will run at build time
    - during development will run on every request.
